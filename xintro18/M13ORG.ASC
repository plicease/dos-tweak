a. Imagine that the top of the screen looks like this (pixel values are
   represented by color digits 0-9 for simplicity - actual colors may
   range from 0 to 255) - a screen width of 320 pixels is assumed:

    address:  0         10                310      319
             ----------------------------------------
             |0123456789012345    .....   0123456789|
             |                                      |
             |                                      |
             |

b. In VGA memory, the screen is represented as follows (question marks
   represent unused bytes):

   Plane 0:

    address:  0         10                310      319
             ----------------------------------------
             |0???4???8???2???    .....   ??2???6???|
             |                                      |
             |                                      |

   Plane 1:

    address:  0         10                310      319
             ----------------------------------------
             |?1???5???9???3??    .....   ???3???7??|
             |                                      |
             |                                      |

   Plane 2:

    address:  0         10                310      319
             ----------------------------------------
             |??2???6???0???4?    .....   0???4???8?|
             |                                      |
             |                                      |

   Plane 3:

    address:  0         10                310      319
             ----------------------------------------
             |???3???7???1???5    .....   ?1???5???9|
             |                                      |
             |                                      |

   I.e. a plane is selected automatically by the two least significant
   bits of the address of the byte being read from or written two.
   This renders 3/4 of the video memory unavailable and useless, but
   all visible pixels are easily accessed, as each address in the video
   segment provides access to one and ONLY ONE pixel.
